## How to run locally

Requirements: Node.js and npm ([install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)).

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Tech stack

- TypeScript
- React

## Deploy

Build and serve:

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

The `start` script serves the built app from `dist` (e.g. for Render or other static hosting).
